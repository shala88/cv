  <p> My background as a <em><a href="https://houstonwomensclinic.com">Women’s Reproductive Options Counselors</a></em> has taught me the importance of understanding the needs of the individual. I pride myself in being profiecient at problem solving
    and I have included that in many design projects where my focus is to create intuitive and visually stimulating experiences. I am primarily self taught and am constantly challenging myself and learning new skills and technologies in interface
    design my goal is to learn more and to embrace problems as an opportunity to grow. I have a passion for studying design and design criticism so that I can be more efficient in upgrading my style for best practices. I enjoy observing and staying
    on top of design trends to inform my creative process. I am a self motivated person but I love to collaborate, brainstorm and use a hands on approach when helping clients with their needs.
    I currently hold a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and believe that it has been pertinent in preparing me with the skills I need to be an efficient intern/employee. My undergrad experiences allowed me to become familiar in Statistical
    Analysis, Color theory and was critical in enhancing my writing and verbal communication skills,
    In between the time of me receiving my degree and working full time I have found myself fascinated with design, Design Sofwares and how they can enhance our everyday lives. Because of my interest in technology and design I have decided to return
    back to school to pursue a Bachelors in Computer Science and am actively a student at the <strong><a href="https://www.uhd.edu/academics/sciences/computer-science-engineering-technology/Pages/cset-degree-plan-bs-cs.aspx">University of
        Houston-Downtown</a></strong>.
    I am applying for the internship Experience Design at Pros because I believe that <a href="https://pros.com">PROS</a> is an amazing company that cares about the customers needs and experiences with technology. I am amazed by the innovation of
    the company and its evolution to success. I believe that a PROS internship would be the best opportunity for me to build my knowledge bank in the UX design field and I would be delighted to be a contributor if I were to be offered this
    opportunity.
